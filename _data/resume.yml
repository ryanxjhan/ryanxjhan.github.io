    contents:
        - Predicted the number of open ion channels present (an essential component of the nervous system), based on electrical properties of biological cells.
        - Extracted meaningful information by applying denoising methods such as wavelet and average smoothing.
        - Built a pipeline that normalizes and adujsts features through Random Forest Classifier that leads to superior results.
        - Tuned and ensembled a series of WaveNet models, which achieved an accuracy (F1-score) of 94.4%.
